# AGH

Use this skill when operating AGH or contributing to the AGH repository. This body is a router, not the full manual. Load the matching reference before acting.

## Required Reading Router

Match the task to the row. Read the listed files in full before producing output. They are not appendices. Inline reminders in this file are only tripwires.

| Task                                                                                                                       | MUST read                                                               |

## Operating Loop

1. Identify whether the work is operator use, external-agent use, or AGH repository contribution.
2. Read every reference selected by the router before acting.
3. Prefer AGH-native tools and structured outputs over prose, logs, or direct internal access when managing AGH.
4. Keep authority with the daemon: task state, review verdicts, session lifecycle, memory, capabilities, bundles, hooks, and network sends must use AGH public surfaces.
5. For repository contribution, follow the local repo instructions before editing, including the relevant AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and skill dispatch rules.
6. Finish with fresh verification evidence that matches the scope of the claim.

**STOP. Read references/tools-and-skills.md and references/native-tools.md in full before discovering, invoking, creating, or modifying any AGH tool or skill.** The catalog in this file is only a router.

**STOP. Read references/tasks-and-orchestration.md in full before acting as a coordinator, worker, or reviewer.** Task authority and review verdicts are runtime contracts, not prompt conventions.

**STOP. Read references/qa-and-verification.md in full before claiming AGH work is complete.** Passing a narrow command is not evidence for a broad completion claim.
